### CREATOR NOTE:
I worked solo as I did not want to freeload as a part of a jam team while I was putting recovering from exhaustion ahead of anything else during the weekend. Glidern is an experiment on creating pleasant spaceship controls with "six degrees of freedom". The level is procedurally generated but the game does not feature level generation, even though it would be cool I thought that it is not the point. Personally, I could float around in the level for hours, but I think that I had to add collecting stuff to make more than just a virtual toy. Making a WebGL build was also a last-minute decision to make the game more accessible. Lighting is a bit broken in it, but it does the job for the most part.
